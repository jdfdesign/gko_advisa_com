The cost of this type of mission will correspond to its specific nature, the complexity and the workload involved in the handling of this file. It is to be noted that according to the mission entrusted, this invoicing may be part of general invoicing. The amount of fees will be communicated beforehand to the client for approval through a mission letter.</li>\r\n<li><strong>at the signing of the notary’s deed : </strong>the remuneration collected represents a percentage of the price of the real estate property acquired, not including notary’s fees. Fees are invoiced to the client, in accordance with the mandate signed between the parties. In a clear manner, any retrocession of commission otherwise obtained will be deducted from the remuneration due at the end of the mission. Indeed, <strong>VIADIM</strong> negotiates at best in the interest of its buyer client sharing the agency commission that the real estate agent partner has contracted with the selling owner (via the sale mandate entitling it to sell the property/properties of the seller). Thus should this occur (it does often), <strong>VIADIM</strong>’s client does not pay the fee amount initially defined in the search request. This sharing of fees, known as inter-office or inter-agency, will be mentioned in the notary’s preliminary sale deed and final sale deed. =&gt; <strong>rates</strong> : the amount of fees is contractually established between the parties and comprises between 2% (Two per cent) or 5% (Five per cent) all taxes included of the real estate property sale price, not including the notary’s fees.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>in order to ensure confidentiality, security and continuity in the quality of services, each of our clients enjoys a <strong>single and sole team member’s support and personalized follow-up</strong>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul><li><strong>guarantees : VIADIM </strong>subscribes a Professional Liability insurance policy and a financial guarantee covering the risks linked to the carrying out of the profession of real estate agency.</li>\r\n    \r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p class=\"lead\"><br />Investing in real estate on Saint Barths implies for investors their carrying out their administrative processes from a remote location and devoting precious time to them, a source of fatigue, stress, loss of time and money.

It nevertheless may be contractually established that for any mission entrusted exceeding the ordinary search for a real estate property (legal, regulatory, tax, technical or financial aspects), invoiced consulting fees will be established. The cost of this type of mission will correspond to its specific nature, the complexity and the workload involved in the handling of this file. It is to be noted that according to the mission entrusted, this invoicing may be part of general invoicing. The amount of fees will be communicated beforehand to the client for approval through a mission letter.</li>\r\n<li><strong>at the signing of the notary’s deed : </strong>the remuneration collected represents a percentage of the price of the real estate property acquired, not including notary’s fees. Fees are invoiced to the client, in accordance with the mandate signed between the parties. In a clear manner, any retrocession of commission otherwise obtained will be deducted from the remuneration due at the end of the mission. Indeed, <strong>VIADIM</strong> negotiates at best in the interest of its buyer client sharing the agency commission that the real estate agent partner has contracted with the selling owner (via the sale mandate entitling it to sell the property/properties of the seller). Thus should this occur (it does often), <strong>VIADIM</strong>’s client does not pay the fee amount initially defined in the search request. This sharing of fees, known as inter-office or inter-agency, will be mentioned in the notary’s preliminary sale deed and final sale deed. =&gt; <strong>rates</strong> : the amount of fees is contractually established between the parties and comprises between 2% (Two per cent) or 5% (Five per cent) all taxes included of the real estate property sale price, not including the notary’s fees.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>in order to ensure confidentiality, security and continuity in the quality of services, each of our clients enjoys a <strong>single and sole team member’s support and personalized follow-up</strong>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul><li><strong>guarantees : VIADIM </strong>subscribes a Professional Liability insurance policy and a financial guarantee covering the risks linked to the carrying out of the profession of real estate agency.</li>\r\n \r\n </ul>\r\n <p class=\"lead\"><br />Investing in real estate on Saint Barths implies for investors their carrying out their administrative processes from a remote location and devoting precious time to them, a source of fatigue, stress, loss of time and money. Our work thus consists of simplifying their search, the <strong>VIADIM</strong> team being at their disposal to enable them to remain <strong>“connected”</strong> to the Saint Barths real estate market.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"btn btn-large btn-inverse btn-block\" href=\"/en/contact-us\">Request for complementary information</a>\r\n</p>', `updated_at` = '2013-08-22 05:29:25' WHERE `section_translations`.`id` = 72

These operations are subject to regulations and are carried out with the assistance of a notary, especially in the context of evaluations such as that of the property, of the reference rent to be taken into consideration in the definition of the life annuity rent to be paid or collected. The latter may also be the object of adjustments according to an agreement between the seller and the buyer, the aim being to find the best possible balance to answer the requirements and the expectation of each of the parties concerned. This type of investment is known as “socially responsible” as it enables the seller to collect revenue and ensure his end of life in a dignified manner.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Main legal reference texts :</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>articles 605, 606, 696, 1964 of the French Civil Code</li>\r\n<li>articles 14 to 33 fifth paragraph, 885 G and 762 of the French General Tax Code.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h4>Shared ownership</h4>\r\n      <p>In order to better understand : we propose the realization of a co-ownership Saint Barths real estate investment to some of our clients. The aim is to enable them to possess a real estate property for a lesser amount of money. This form of ownership started with the means of possession generally encountered in some sectors such as, jets and luxury yachts. Thanks to this method, owners buy a fraction of the villa and only bear and finance a relatively moderate part of the purchase and upkeep cost of the real estate property. Each investor thus acquires one or several weeks according to pre-established rates. The principle is thus simple : Shared co-ownership, is a luxury villa on Saint Barths with the advantages linked to the holding of a holiday residence and the services of 5 star hotel, without the disadvantages of management, maintenance and upkeep, for a smaller investment. It’s useless to pay 100% of the price for a holiday house when you only use it a few weeks per year.</p>\r\n<p>French law enables the sharing of the use of a real estate property through a company holding, either the company shares in full ownership, or in divided property according to the financing used. Its articles of incorporation specify the co-ownership property method of operation and the rights each of the co-owner investor associates hold. The right of occupation is linked to the holding of shares. Each co-owner holds a property title, a real right, in the form of shares of the company holding the concerned real estate property, which shares may be resold as may be any other real estate property.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Main legal reference texts :</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>​January 6th, 1986 law number 86-18, regarding the companies attributing immovable property for use in shared time slots</li>\r\n<li>articles L. 212-1, L. 261-10 and following of the French Construction and Housing Code</li>\r\n<li>​articles 1655 third paragraph, 372 to 375 and 60 of the French General Tax Code.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h4>Our other solutions</h4>\r\n    <p>Each of our clients being unique, their needs in terms of real estate vary according to their priorities and the goals they wish to reach.

These operations are subject to regulations and are carried out with the assistance of a notary, especially in the context of evaluations such as that of the property, of the reference rent to be taken into consideration in the definition of the life annuity rent to be paid or collected. The latter may also be the object of adjustments according to an agreement between the seller and the buyer, the aim being to find the best possible balance to answer the requirements and the expectation of each of the parties concerned. This type of investment is known as “socially responsible” as it enables the seller to collect revenue and ensure his end of life in a dignified manner.</p>\r\n <p><strong>Main legal reference texts :</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n <li>articles 605, 606, 696, 1964 of the French Civil Code</li>\r\n<li>articles 14 to 33 fifth paragraph, 885 G and 762 of the French General Tax Code.</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n <h4>Shared ownership</h4>\r\n <p>In order to better understand : we propose the realization of a co-ownership Saint Barths real estate investment to some of our clients. The aim is to enable them to possess a real estate property for a lesser amount of money. This form of ownership started with the means of possession generally encountered in some sectors such as, jets and luxury yachts. Thanks to this method, owners buy a fraction of the villa and only bear and finance a relatively moderate part of the purchase and upkeep cost of the real estate property. Each investor thus acquires one or several weeks according to pre-established rates. The principle is thus simple : Shared co-ownership, is a luxury villa on Saint Barths with the advantages linked to the holding of a holiday residence and the services of 5 star hotel, without the disadvantages of management, maintenance and upkeep, for a smaller investment. It’s useless to pay 100% of the price for a holiday house when you only use it a few weeks per year.</p>\r\n<p>French law enables the sharing of the use of a real estate property through a company holding, either the company shares in full ownership, or in divided property according to the financing used. Its articles of incorporation specify the co-ownership property method of operation and the rights each of the co-owner investor associates hold. The right of occupation is linked to the holding of shares. Each co-owner holds a property title, a real right, in the form of shares of the company holding the concerned real estate property, which shares may be resold as may be any other real estate property.</p>\r\n <p><strong>Main legal reference texts :</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n <li>​January 6th, 1986 law number 86-18, regarding the companies attributing immovable property for use in shared time slots</li>\r\n<li>articles L. 212-1, L. 261-10 and following of the French Construction and Housing Code</li>\r\n<li>​articles 1655 third paragraph, 372 to 375 and 60 of the French General Tax Code.</li>\r\n </ul>\r\n <h4>Our other solutions</h4>\r\n <p>Each of our clients being unique, their needs in terms of real estate vary according to their priorities and the goals they wish to reach.
